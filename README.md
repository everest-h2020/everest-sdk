# Everest SDK

TODO:

## General configuration

Run the command ". set_env.sh" before proceeding.

## Prerequisite: MLIR Toolchain

The EVEREST SDK relies on a specific revision of the MLIR and CIRCT projects.
The easiest way to obtain and build these is by executing the script `build_mlir.sh`, which will fetch and build both projects.
Be advised that during the compilation process, up to 150GB of space are required temporarily for build artifacts.

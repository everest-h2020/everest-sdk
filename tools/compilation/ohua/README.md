# The Ohua Compiler

This directory contains the Ohua compiler, named `condrust`. It is used in the EVEREST SDK to translate sequential imperative programs written in Rust or Python to parallelized application compositions.

To build the compiler, follow the instructions in the README file of the submodule.
